You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

 

Example 1:


Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
Example 2:

Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order."""
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):

        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: ListNode, list2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        # Dummy node to start the merged list
        dummy = ListNode()
        current = dummy

        # While both lists have nodes left to process
        while list1 and list2:
            if list1.val <= list2.val:
                current.next = list1
                list1 = list1.next
            else:
                current.next = list2
                list2 = list2.next
            current = current.next

        # Attach the remaining nodes from either list1 or list2
        if list1:
            current.next = list1
        elif list2:
            current.next = list2

        # The merged list starts from dummy.next
        return dummy.next
